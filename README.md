# CarDealershipTest
This was a pressure project I did as part of an interview where I had 4 hours to throw together a car dealership management application. 

It had two pages of requirements which I had to read and digest within the 4 hour limit. I'm not going to reveal the
actual requirements, but you should be able to get the general idea that it needed features like being able to view inventory
and add new inventory etc. etc.
